# ABSTRACT
This project presents a design of weather monitoring system. Weather monitoring plays an important role in human life, so the collection of information about the temporal dynamic of weather changes is very important.It stores data collected at some pre-determined sampling intervel, with data and time stamps for lateral retrieval with real-time notifications for supervision and analysis of different environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, air quality, light intensity, amount of rainfall and co-ordinates of the location. It consists of an Arduino UNO (micro-processor) which acts as a gateway to collect data and information through different probes. Such type of system can be used in controlled environment like agriculture farms and aqua culture. The idea behind it is mainly weather monitoring and forcasting at micro-ecological level, monitoring upcoming situations to sound alerts during unfavorable circumstances.
