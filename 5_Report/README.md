# ABSTRACT
This project presents a design of weather monitoring system. Weather monitoring plays an important role in human life, so the collection of information about the temporal dynamic of weather changes is very important.It stores data collected at some pre-determined sampling intervel, with data and time stamps for lateral retrieval with real-time notifications for supervision and analysis of different environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, air quality, light intensity, amount of rainfall and co-ordinates of the location. It consists of an Arduino UNO (micro-processor) which acts as a gateway to collect data and information through different probes. Such type of system can be used in controlled environment like agriculture farms and aqua culture. The idea behind it is mainly weather monitoring and forcasting at micro-ecological level, monitoring upcoming situations to sound alerts during unfavorable circumstances.
# INTRODUCTION
Weather forecasting is the application of science and tecnology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a given location. Human beings have a attempted to predict the weather informally for millennium and formally since the nineteenth century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere on a given place and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how atmosphere will evolve on the place. Weather is driven by air pressure differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The atmosphere is a chaotic system, so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole.This makes it difficult to accurately predict weather more than a few days in advance, though weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through the scientific study of weather,meteorology. It is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.

# CONCLUSION 
A weather parameter monitoring system with a GUI has been successfully designed and developed using a low cost rainfall. wind speed, temperature and humidity sensors. The sensors are being handshake to an low cost rainfall, wind speed, temperature and humidity sensors. The sensors are being handshake to an ATMEGA 328P microcontroller while the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module facilities the communication link between the collected data and the GUI environment on the computer system created for data archiving. The developed microcontroller program written in C language was embedded into a microcontroller to give readings of rainfall, wind speed, temperature and humidity in an interval of every 10 minutes which is also a method of data collection in most Meteorological Agency Stations. With this system,easy access to database of information at any time when the need arises is guaranteed.
