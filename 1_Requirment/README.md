# INTRODUCTION:
Weather forecasting is the application of science and tecnology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a given location. Human beings have a attempted to predict the weather informally for millennium and formally since the nineteenth century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere on a given place and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how atmosphere will evolve on the place.
Weather is driven by air pressure differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The atmosphere is a chaotic system, so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole.This makes it difficult to accurately predict weather more than a few days in advance, though weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through the scientific study of weather,meteorology. It is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.
